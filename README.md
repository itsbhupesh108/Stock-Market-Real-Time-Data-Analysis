# Stock-Market-Real-Time-Data-Analysis
Developed a real-time stock market data pipeline using Kafka and Zookeeper. A Kafka producer streams data to S3, with AWS Glue crawling and cataloging it. Used Athena for querying and Python for analytics, ensuring scalable, low-latency financial data processing and insights.
